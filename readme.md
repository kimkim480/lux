## What is Lux?

- Lux is a statically typed, stack-based programming language designed for learning and exploration.
- It is built from scratch in Rust with a custom virtual machine called Prism.
- Its purpose: to shine light through the chaos of runtime errors — with clarity, intention, and precision.

## Goals of Lux

- **Clarity** over cleverness
- **Static typing** from the ground up
- **Minimalist syntax**, inspired by light and structure
- Built to **learn**, not necessarily to ship

## Primitive Types in Lux

| Lux Type | Conventional Equivalent | Purpose                    | "Why This Name?"                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Light`  | `int`/`float`           | Numeric values (all sizes) | Fundamental energy — numbers as the measurable force   |
| `Lumens` | `string`                | Textual data               | Measured brightness — strings as visible communication |
| `Umbra`  | `void`/`nil`/`null`     | Absence of value           | The deepest shadow — no light, no value                |
| `Photon` | `bool`                  | Truth values (true/false)  | Quantum particle of light — binary truth               |
