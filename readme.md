## What is Lux?

- Lux is a statically typed, stack-based programming language designed for learning and exploration.
- It is built from scratch in Rust with a custom virtual machine called Prism.
- Its purpose: to shine light through the chaos of runtime errors — with clarity, intention, and precision.

## Goals of Lux

- **Clarity** over cleverness
- **Static typing** from the ground up
- **Minimalist syntax**, inspired by light and structure
- Built to **learn**, not necessarily to ship

## Primitive Types in Lux

| Lux Type | Conventional Equivalent | Purpose                        | "Why This Name?"                             |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Light`  | `int`/`float`           | Numeric values (all sizes)     | **Light** = pure, fundamental energy         |
| `Lumens` | `string`                | Text data                      | **Lumens** = measurable "brightness" of text |
| `Umbra`  | `nil`/`null`            | Absence of value (shadow type) | **Umbra** = shadow (absence of light)        |
| `Photon` | `bool`                  | Truth values (true/false)      | **Quantum of light** = Binary truth          |
